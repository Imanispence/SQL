For this project I downloaded Spotify data from Kagglethen then created a table to insert Spotify data. I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

 I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table, then analyzed the data using the following SQL. 

What is the average danceability of all songs by Ariana Grande? Round to two decimal place.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(danceability),2) AS avg_danceability
FROM Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name = 'Ariana Grande';

Which artists have a popularity of 90 or more?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity>= 90;

What is the average tempo of the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(tempo), popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

What is the shortest song done by each artist?
SELECT artist_name, 
MIN(duration_ms) as shortest_song, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY shortest_song;

Determine the type of song where danceability of 0.5 or higher is fun and anything less is boring.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability,
CASE WHEN danceability >= 0.5 THEN 'Fun'
ELSE 'Boring'
END AS 'Song Type'
FROM Spotifydata
