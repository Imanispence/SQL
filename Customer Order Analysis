#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
WHERE price <> 'Price Each'
AND Product <> 'Product'
GROUP by Product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity) *price as revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT COUNT(Product),Quantity, 
SUM(Quantity) *price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct acctnum), 
AVG(price*quantity)
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
